The university has laid out specific rules and expectations regarding student conduct, dressing, and overall discipline. As a fresher, understanding and adhering to these guidelines will help you stay focused and avoid trouble throughout your academic journey.
  </p>  <h2>1. General Conduct Rules</h2>
  <p>All students at SAZUG are expected to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Respect lecturers, university staff, and fellow students.</li>
    <li>Attend all lectures, tutorials, and practical sessions punctually.</li>
    <li>Refrain from all forms of exam malpractice and academic dishonesty.</li>
    <li>Protect university property and avoid vandalism.</li>
    <li>Avoid any form of cultism, harassment, or violence.</li>
  </ul>  <h2>2. Attendance and Punctuality</h2>
  <p>
    Attendance is taken seriously at SAZUG. Most departments require students to attend at least 75% of lectures to be eligible to sit for exams. Failure to meet this threshold can result in carryovers or academic probation.
  </p>  <h2>3. Dress Code Guidelines</h2>
  <p>
    SAZUG promotes decent and responsible dressing. While students are allowed to express themselves, certain dressing styles are considered inappropriate on campus. The following are the expected dress standards:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Male Students:</strong> No sagging trousers, sleeveless shirts, or excessive jewelry. Shirts should be properly buttoned and tucked in. Hair should be kept neat and trimmed.</li>
    <li><strong>Female Students:</strong> No revealing clothes, transparent dresses, or very short skirts. Avoid loud makeup and wear modest, respectful attire.</li>
  </ul>  <div class="highlight">
    <strong>Note:</strong> Students may be denied entry into lecture halls or university buildings if they fail to adhere to the dress code.
  </div>  <h2>4. Prohibited Activities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use or possession of drugs, alcohol, or any illicit substance.</li>
    <li>Joining or promoting secret cults or gangs.</li>
    <li>Cheating or impersonation during examinations.</li>
    <li>Fighting, bullying, or any form of abuse against others.</li>
    <li>Organizing unauthorized protests or public disturbances.</li>
  </ul>  <h2>5. Disciplinary Actions</h2>
  <p>
    Violations of university rules may result in:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Verbal or written warning</li>
    <li>Suspension from specific classes or the entire university</li>
    <li>Expulsion depending on the severity of the offense</li>
    <li>Loss of privileges such as access to hostel or library</li>
  </ul>  <h2>6. Use of Student Identity Cards</h2>
  <p>
    Every student must carry their student ID card at all times while on campus. It may be requested by security officers or during exams. Loss of ID should be reported immediately to the Student Affairs Unit for replacement.
  </p>  <h2>7. Relationship with Lecturers and Staff</h2>
  <p>
    Mutual respect is expected. Students should:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Address lecturers and staff with appropriate titles and respect</li>
    <li>Avoid confrontations or arguments</li>
    <li>Report concerns through appropriate channels like the HOD or faculty dean</li>
  </ul>  <h2>8. Social Media Behavior</h2>
  <p>
    Students are expected to use social media responsibly. Do not post false or harmful content about SAZUG, staff, or other students. Negative behavior online can lead to disciplinary action if it violates university values.
  </p>  <div class="highlight">
    <strong>Aliyu's Advice:</strong> "Be disciplined, dress smartly, and respect yourself and others. You’re building your future from day one."
  </div>  <h2>9. Safety and Security Tips</h2>

Freshers should take these seriously and act accordingly. Your image, future, and academic journey all depend on how well you behave.
