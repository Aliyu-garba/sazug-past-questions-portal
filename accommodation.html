  <h1>Accommodation - SAZUG Freshers Guide</h1>

  <p>
    Finding a comfortable and safe place to stay is one of the first major concerns for freshers at <strong>Sa’adu Zungur University, Bauchi State (SAZUG)</strong>. The university offers on-campus hostels as well as the option to stay off-campus in private apartments. Each option comes with its own pros and cons, depending on your level, budget, and preferences.
  </p>

  <h2>1. On-Campus Accommodation (School Hostel)</h2>
  <p>
    As a 100-level or 400-level student, you are eligible to reserve school accommodation through the SAZUG student portal. Simply log in and complete the hostel application under your dashboard. Priority is given to freshers and final year students for better access to university facilities.
  </p>
  <p>
    The hostel fee is usually around <strong>₦15,000</strong> per session. Each room accommodates a maximum of 8 students. It’s advisable for new students to apply for the school hostel during their first year, as it helps you understand your surroundings, meet other freshers, and adjust easily to campus life before considering off-campus options.
  </p>

  <div class="highlight">
    <strong>Advice:</strong> As a fresher, staying in the school hostel during your first year will help you understand how things work on campus before considering off-campus housing in future years.
  </div>

  <div class="highlight">
    <strong>Aliyu's Advice:</strong> "Don’t be in a rush. Take your time to find a safe and comfortable place that fits your budget."
  </div>

  <h2>2. Off-Campus Accommodation</h2>
  <p>
    Students in 200-level and 300-level are generally expected to move off-campus. There are many private accommodations near the university, ranging from affordable self-contained apartments to fully furnished flats. Prices vary depending on location and quality:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Basic room: ₦60,000 – ₦100,000 per year</li>
    <li>Standard single apartment: ₦150,000 – ₦200,000+</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Most off-campus hostels are located around Gadau town and are within walking or bike distance from the campus. When choosing off-campus housing, always inspect the place physically, confirm power and water supply, and ask older students for honest reviews.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Important Things to Consider</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Distance from campus – can you walk or will you need transport?</li>
    <li>Is there steady light and water supply?</li>
    <li>Security and the environment – is the area safe?</li>
    <li>Do you want a shared apartment or a self-contained room?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Hostel Rules and What to Expect</h2>
  <p>
    If you’re staying in the school hostel, there are rules you must follow. These include lights-out times, no cooking inside rooms, no unauthorized visitors, and a clean environment policy. There are usually hostel officers to supervise and respond to student needs.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Extra Tip That Can Help You</h2>
  <div class="highlight">
    <strong>Freshers Tip:</strong> “Always document any payment or agreement made for off-campus housing. Collect a receipt and, if possible, have a witness or video/photo record during rent negotiations.”
  </div>

  <h2>6. Where to Get Help</h2>
  <p>
    For questions regarding on-campus accommodation, visit the SAZUG Student Affairs Office. They handle all official hostel arrangements. For off-campus options, older students, SUG members, or student WhatsApp groups can guide you to trusted landlords.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Whether you're staying on-campus or off-campus, your accommodation plays a big role in your academic success. Consider your budget, safety, comfort, and proximity to classes. As a fresher, staying on-campus is a wise decision because it helps you settle into campus life and focus on your studies with fewer distractions.
