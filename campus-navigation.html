  <h2>8. Common Lecture Venues for Freshers</h2>
  <p>
    As a fresher, most of your lectures will likely be held in major lecture halls known for their large seating capacity and easy access. These halls include the <strong>Butterfly Building</strong>, <strong>500 Seaters</strong>, <strong>Circular Hall</strong>, <strong>Linear Hall</strong>, and <strong>Pentagon Hall</strong>. These venues are commonly used for first-year general courses because they are spacious and centrally located.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>Butterfly Building</strong> is especially popular among freshers and is easy to recognize due to its unique architectural shape. The <strong>500 Seaters</strong> and <strong>Pentagon Hall</strong> are also large lecture halls often used for GST and departmental general courses. Each of these halls is clearly labeled, so be sure to check your course timetable to know where your lectures are scheduled. If you're confused, don’t hesitate to ask a fellow student or security officer for directions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Knowing these common venues early will save you time and prevent you from getting lost, especially in your first few weeks. Walk around with a friend, and take note of your lecture halls in advance.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Campus navigation is a skill that improves with time. Within a few weeks, you'll become familiar with the buildings, lecture venues, offices, and shortcuts. Don’t hesitate to ask questions and stay friendly with fellow students — they are your best guides.
