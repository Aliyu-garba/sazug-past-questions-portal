  <h1>Registration & Matric Number - SAZUG Freshers Guide</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to <strong>Sa'adu Zungur University, Bauchi State (SAZUG)</strong>. As a fresher, your first essential step is to complete your student registration and receive your official matriculation number. This guide walks you through the entire process in a practical and beginner-friendly way.
  </p>

  <h2>1. SAZUG Registration Process Overview</h2>
  <p>
    At SAZUG, student registration happens in two parts:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Online Registration:</strong> Done via the official SAZUG portal to make payments and complete your profile.</li>
    <li><strong>Physical Clearance:</strong> Done at your department/faculty after completing the online steps.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Step-by-Step Online Registration</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Visit the Portal:</strong> Go to <em>https://www.sazug.edu.ng</em> and navigate to the “Student Portal”.</li>
    <li><strong>Create Account/Login:</strong> Use your JAMB registration number to create a student profile.</li>
    <li><strong>Make Payment:</strong> Generate your Remita (RRR) and make your acceptance fee or school fee payment via Remita.</li>
    <li><strong>Complete Profile:</strong> After payment, log back into your portal and complete your profile by uploading your signature and filling medical information and biodata.</li>
    <li><strong>Download Payment Receipt & Forms:</strong> Print out your registration slip and course form.</li>
  </ol>

  <div class="highlight">
    <strong>Note:</strong> You do not need to upload separate documents manually. Just complete all required information on the portal including signature and health information. Keep both hard and soft copies of everything.
  </div>

  <h2>3. Physical Clearance at Campus</h2>
  <p>
    After completing your portal registration, proceed to your faculty for verification:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Submit printed registration slip and course form.</li>
    <li>Provide photocopies of necessary credentials.</li>
    <li>Meet with your Department’s Course Adviser.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Getting Your Matriculation Number</h2>
  <p>
    After your successful registration, your <strong>Matric Number</strong> will appear automatically on your registration receipt and course registration form. 
    For example: <strong>CSCU/25/2452</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    No separate step is required to request your matric number — once your registration is confirmed, it is issued instantly by the system.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Importance of Your Matric Number</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>It serves as your official university ID throughout your studies.</li>
    <li>Used for exam clearance, hostel application, course registration, and checking results.</li>
    <li>Appears on all transcripts and your final certificate.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not use someone else’s email or phone number.</li>
    <li>Make sure all information filled is accurate and matches your documents.</li>
    <li>Don’t forget to print your receipts and course form after payment.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Where to Get Help</h2>
  <p>
    For technical issues or confusion during the registration process, visit the SAZUG ICT Center located near the main administrative block.
    You can also get help from your faculty officers, student union reps, or the university’s official social media channels.
